The Olympia, since opening in 1893, has witnessed changes in entertainment and pop culture for almost 130 years from the can-can through Édith Piaf to Johnny Hallyday and the Beatles and now… Alice Cooper! This 90 minute rock show is a journey through Alice Cooper’s timeless creations: classics like “Poison”, “School’s Out” and “No More Mr. Nice Guy” are alternated with hand-picked gems for the joy of true Cooper connoisseurs like “Pain”, “Woman of Mass Distraction” and “Paranoic Personality,” the first single from the album “Paranormal”. This concert captures a rock and roll show at its peak and is one of the best live releases by Alice Cooper, featuring his longtime band guitarists Nita Strauss, Tommy Henriksen and Ryan Roxie, bassist Chuck Garric and drummer Glen Sobel in front of an excited audience.',
